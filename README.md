# Ahem... attention plz

First off.... thanks for considering my application.
Secondly. I've created a theme called ikonic. Everything's in there. I've also created a test page with slug dtest to test things out before I submit this demo. You can also use the same page as you wish.

Needless to say, I'm not including any DBs or anything so you'll need to create the Projects, Project types and menus etc to properly test things out. I've used a plugin called FakerPress to generate dummy data, it'll be in the plugins folder so you can just go ahead and use it. Takes away a lot of hassle.

I must clarify at this point that I assumed you don't need me to create astonishing UIs so I didn't bother with the CSS and only focused on getting the functionality perfect. Also, because this is a WordPress backend test so I'm being tested for backend only. But as I mentioned in my call with HR Department, I'm a full stack dev specializing in Laravel and WordPress. I seek to advance my career whichever way I can.

If there's ANYTHING you need, feel free to hit me up at my email or PREFERABLY whatsapp - 0306 8137814. I check my emails once a day or so. I mean c'mon, let's be real. Emails are boring.
